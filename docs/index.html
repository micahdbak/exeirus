Welcome to <b>EXEIRUS</b>.




This is a game. Complete it, and you will be rewarded.

You will come accross a great many puzzles. By solving a puzzle, your solution
will guide you to the next puzzle. But do not rush, for every puzzle contains
something else that is vital to this game's completion. Keep an eye out for
things that look awry, because there are <b>keys</b> hidden in every puzzle, in nearly
every page.

A key looks something like this, when it is found:

<i>1-a1b2c3d4</i>

But it might not look like that initially. It might be the solution to a
cipher, or hidden in an image, or a variety of other things. Look well.

The leading digit of a key is the position of that key in the <b>master-key</b>, and the
characters following the hyphen is the content of the key itself.

Suppose that you have found the following keys:

<i>1-a1b2c3d4
2-e5f6g7h8
3-i9j0k1l2
4-m3n4o5p6</i>
<span style="color: black">5-P8c0</span>
Then the <b>master-key</b> is completed by combining these keys as such:

<i>a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6</i>

This <b>master-key</b> is then used by going to the URL:

<i>$DOMAIN$/a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6.html</i>

(where the <b>master-key</b> follows <i>$DOMAIN$/</i> and is terminated
with <i>.html</i>.)

By completing the actual <b>master-key</b> of <b>EXEIRUS</b>, you complete the game. The URL
created using the <b>master-key</b> is proof of your completion. Actual keys will be of
variable length, and will contain characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, and ~.

Immediately upon completion, notify <b>Micah</b>. He can be contacted:
- in person (where he will be in the CSSS common room more often than normal),
- via email at <u>csss-fyr-current@sfu.ca</u>, or
- via Discord at <u>micah#7007</u>.

All manner of puzzles are before you. Think outside of the box, think clearly.
Nothing is as it seems. You will need to employ abnormal strategies on several
occasions.




With this all said, this page is your first puzzle.

Find the next puzzle.
Find the key.




Good luck,

<b>EXEIRUS</b>
