Welcome to $EXEIRUS$.
\P
Good job finding this page.
Although, considering what lies before you, that was nothing.
\P
We are $EXEIRUS$, and you are a candidate to become one of us.
This journal that you see before you has puzzles strewn throughout.
Likewise with \(iNous\)iTele, that preceding website.
Look well, left and right, and keep your brows furrowed.
To complete every puzzle is to complete your registration.
\P
But do not rush, for every puzzle contains something else that is vital to your success.
Keep an eye out for things that look awry, because there are \(bkeys\)b hidden in every puzzle, in nearly every page.
\P
A \(bkey\)b looks something like this, when it is found:
\P
\(m
1:a1b2c3d4
\)m

Your wit is yet to be rewarded.

Behold, a key:

                  _                 ___ ____ ____ ____  
  /\\  /\\__ _  ___| | _____ _ __    / __\\ ___| ___| ___| 
 / /_/ / _` |/ __| |/ / _ \\ '__|  / /  |___ \\___ \\___ \\

\\/ /_/ \\__,_|\\___|_|\\_\\___|_|    \\____/|____/____/____/

\P
But it might not look like that initially.
It might be the solution to a cipher, or hidden in an image, or a variety of other things.
\P
The leading digit of a \(bkey\)b is the position of that key in the \(bmaster-key\)b.
The characters following the colon is the content of the \(bkey\)b itself.
\P
Suppose that you have found the following \(bkeys\)b:
\P
\(m
1:a1b2c3d4
<span style="color:#7dd">2:e5f6g7h8</span>
<span style="color:#dd7">3:i9j0k1l2</span>
<span style="color:#d7d">4:m3n4o5p6</span>
\)m
\P
Then the \(bmaster-key\)b is completed by combining these \(bkeys\)b like so:
\P
\(m
a1b2c3d4<span style="color:#7dd">e5f6g7h8</span><span style="color:#dd7">i9j0k1l2</span><span style="color:#d7d">m3n4o5p6</span>
\)m
\P
Actual \(bkeys\)b, different to the examples shown above, will be of variable length.
They contain the characters \(ma-z\)m, \(mA-Z\)m, \(m0-9\)m, \(m-\)m, and \(m~\)m; 64 possible characters.
\P
How you must use this \(bmaster-key\)b is yet to be discovered.
Perhaps if you discover what job it is that we require candidates for, then that might reveal the gate.
\P
All manner of puzzles are before you.\n
Think outside of the box, think clearly.\n
\(bNothing is as it seems.\)b\n
You will need to employ abnormal strategies on several occasions.
\P
Good luck.
