Once Upon A Time,
\P
There was a man named Caesar.\n
\P
He sat upon his mount,\n
sixty-four steps high;\n
\P
the lower caste came first,\n
twenty-six in all,\n
then the upper caste,\n
yet another twenty-six,\n
followed discretely by the ten Digitae.\n
But above them all---\n
who could take their place\n
next only to highly Caesar?\n
But two;\n
for Caesar was fond of Hyphenus,\n
but most of all, Tildeus.\n
\P
So is the order,\n
first at the bottom,\n
last at the top,\n
by preference of Caesar.\n
\P
Then, Caesar,\n
upon speaking to Tildeus,\n
learnt of a dozen sheep stolen.\n
\P
To Tildeus' dismay,\n
Caesar quickly retorted:\n
-AG pup uF! c:56bwdi4V uE Ftq EqoAzp wqK.\n
And Tildeus never let a thief roam once more.
