Once Upon A Time,\n
There was a man named Caesar,\n
King of the Roman Empire.\n
Twenty-six people worshiped him,\n
All from the lower caste.\n
But he was a human,\n
like everyone else,\n
and he knew,\n
death will come for him, eventually.\n
that is why he wrote a secret message,\n
which ought to be opened when he died.\n
A man named Zeus,\n
A close friend of Caesar,\n
Found that the secret message,\n
was a code, waiting to be unlocked,\n
by a number, who knows.\n
The only hint he ever gave,\n
was a word: lines.\n
Caesar said to his people:\n
Who ever solves it first,\n
will be the next king.\n
\(iCaesar is dead!\)i\n
The message said : <span style="font-family: monospace">vlr afa fq! 1:nvhlxope fp qeb cfopq hbv.</span>
