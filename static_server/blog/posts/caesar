Once Upon A Time,
\P
There was a man named Caesar,\n
Lord of the Roman Empire.
\P
He sat upon his mount,\n
sixty-four steps high.
\P
the lower caste came first,\n
twenty-six in all,\n
then the upper caste,\n
yet another twenty-six.
\P
Following discretely,\n
the ten Digitae.
\P
But above them all---\n
who could take their place\n
next only to highly Caesar?
\P
But two;\n
for Caesar was fond of Hyphenus,\n
and above: Tildeus.
\P
So is the order,\n
by preference of Caesar.
\P
Then, Caesar,\n
upon speaking to Tildeus,\n
learnt of a dozen sheep stolen.
\P
To Tildeus' dismay,\n
Caesar quickly retorted:\n

\P
And Tildeus never let a thief roam once more.
