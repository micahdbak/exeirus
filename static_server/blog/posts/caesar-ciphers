Caesar Ciphers

Dear $EXEIRUS$,
\P
A very common cipher is the Caesar cipher.
It is a simple cipher, effective, but easy to crack.\n
Essentially, given a character set, some input text to encrypt, and a number to shift by,
the Caesar cipher "shifts" every character in the input text by this constant number.
\P
But what do I mean by "shifting"?\n
To "shift" a character, you must first know its numerical value.
Its numerical value is given by its position in a character set.
\P
Let us create a Caesar cipher for example.\n
Our character set will be the following:\n
\(mabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\)m
\P
This character set has 26 characters in it,
and each of these characters has an index representing its position in the character set.
\(ma\)m has the index of \(m0\)m, because it is first,
and \(mz\)m has the index of \(m25\)m, because it is last.
\P
Then suppose that we want to encrypt the text "\(mhello world\)m"
with respect to this character set.
The first step is to represent each character of \(mhello world\)m
as indices in the character set.
\P
So, \(mhello world\)m becomes:
\P
\(m7 4 11 11 14\)m (space) \(m22 14 17 11 3\)m
\P
Notice that the space does not have a numerical value.
This is because it is not contained in the character set.
We will let it carry through to the encrypted form of \(mhello world\)m, unchanged.
\P
Then, we choose a number to shift by.
Let us choose \(m10\)m.
To shift the characters of \(mhello world\)m by \(m10\)m,
we add \(m10\)m to each of the numerical values of the text.
This addition can be referred to as shifting \(iforward\)i.
So the numerical values shown above becomes:
\P
\(m17 14 21 21 24\)m (space) \(m32 24 27 21 13\)m
\P
However, we are not finished just yet.
Notice how some of these numbers are greater than 25,
exceeding the bounds of the character set.
What we must do is allow these characters
that are shifted \(ioutside\)i of the character set
to "loop" back to the start of the character set.
Essentially, we subtract 26 from each of the numbers that exceed 25.
In other words, we modulo 26 every number.\n
The numerical values then become:
\P
\(m17 14 21 21 24\)m (space) \(m6 24 1 21 13\)m
\P
Which, now that each index is within the bounds of the character set,
can be converted to plaintext.
Each numerical value is replaced with the character of that index in the character set.
So it becomes:
\P
\(mrovvy gybvn\)m
\P
To summarize, if we are to shift \(mhello world\)m by \(m10\)m
with respect to the character set \(mabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\)m,
we would get \(mrovvy gybvn\)m.
\P
However, although I just described how to \(iencrypt\)i text with the Caesar cipher,
I have not said anything about \(idecrypting\)i Caesar cipher text.
\P
Luckily, it is simple, and follows easily from encryption.
To decrypt Caesar cipher text, instead of \(iadding\)i the shift value,
that is, shift \(iforward\)i, you \(isubtract\)i the shift value, shift \(ibackward\)i.
But beware, if your indices become negative
you must make it that they are within the bounds of your character set.
So, for example, using the character set \(mabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\)m,
if \(ma\)m is shifted backwards by \(m4\)m, then it becomes \(mw\)m.
Using numerical values, this is done by adding \(m26\)m,
the size of the character set, to the negative index.
