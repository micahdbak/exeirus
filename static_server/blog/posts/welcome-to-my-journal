Greetings, $EXEIRUS$.
\P
It is late now, midnight for me.
\P
I am glad we have formed our group, and I do hope that our efforts will not be in vain.
\P
To reiterate: I recently discovered an underground hacker group by the name of $CICADA$.
They intend to harm world-leading governments by hacking into their infrastructures.
What is their motivation for such an act? I cannot say.
But I doubt their motive is good.
World domination, omnipresence, whatever.
\P
This is why we came together.
We came together to stop this, and prevent a global catastrophe.
\P
The \(iexeirus lateritius\)i, Australian cicada killer wasp, is a brutal thing.
We are called $EXEIRUS$ because we too must be brutal,
and we must dismember $CICADA$ and all of the evil that they stand for.
\P
TLDR:
The purpose of this journal is to publish messages that we wish to voice.
Feel free to post any leads you have against $CICADA$.
\P
\(i\(bNOTE:\)b\)i
\P
If you are not a member of $EXEIRUS$, read on, because one of our members might have lead you here for a reason.
\P
Happy hacking <img src="$DOMAIN$/$BLOG$/static/smile.png">.
