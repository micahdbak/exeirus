\P
Well done, applicant.
\P
We are EXEIRUS.
To start your application, read forth.
\P
The time is now to stop CICADA.
And we need your help.
This journal contains several hidden puzzles that,
upon completion, will lead you to CICADA.
We will keep track of which hackers are making progress at the fastest rate,
given you communicate to us your progress.
This journal has puzzles strewn throughout it.
It is likewise with \(iNous\)iTele, that preceding website.
Look closely; keep your brows furrowed.
To complete every puzzle is to complete your application.
\P
There is an entry-point that you will use to access
CICADA's secret communication channels.
We have heavily encrypted this entry-point using our \(bmaster-key\)b.
To decrypt the entry-point, you will need that \(bmaster-key\)b.
Completing every puzzle in my journal will give you this.
There are \(bkeys\)b everywhere, which, in totality, create the \(bmaster-key\)b.
These \(bkeys\)b are hidden in every puzzle, in nearly every page.
\P
A \(bkey\)b looks something like this, when it is found:
\P
\(m
1:abcdefgh
\)m
<!--
Your wit is yet to be rewarded.

Behold, a key:

7:zoizymce

                  _                 ___ ____ ____ ____  
  /\\  /\\__ _  ___| | _____ _ __    / __\\ ___| ___| ___| 
 / /_/ / _` |/ __| |/ / _ \\ '__|  / /  |___ \\___ \\___ \\ 
/ __  / (_| | (__|   <  __/ |    / /___ ___) |__) |__) |
\\/ /_/ \\__,_|\\___|_|\\_\\___|_|    \\____/|____/____/____/ 
                                                        
-->
\P
But a \(bkey\)b might not look like that initially.
It is probably the plaintext of a cipher,
or perhaps the solution to something else.
\P
The leading number of a \(bkey\)b is the position of that key in the \(bmaster-key\)b.
The characters following the colon is the content of the \(bkey\)b itself.
\P
Suppose that you have found the following \(bkeys\)b:
\P
\(m
<span style="color:#4aa">1:abcdefgh</span>
<span style="color:#f44">2:ijklmnop</span>
<span style="color:#4f4">3:qrstuvwx</span>
<span style="color:#44f">4:yzabcdef</span>
\)m
\P
Then the \(bmaster-key\)b is found by combining these \(bkeys\)b like so:
\P
\(m
<span style="color:#4aa">abcdefgh<span style="color:#f44">ijklmnop</span><span style="color:#4f4">qrstuvwx</span><span style="color:#44f">yzabcdef</span>
\)m
\P
The example \(bkeys\)b shown above are unlike real keys in that they follow a pattern.
Real \(bkeys\)b' content are completely random.
\P
Once you have found the \(bmaster-key\)b and broken our encryption,
you will be able to tackle CICADA head-on.
\P
Every CICADA web-page is found under $DOMAIN$/cicada.
As soon as you are able to access one of CICADA's pages,
\(bcommunicate to us the entire URL of the page you reached\)b.
These URLs should be communicated to us as soon as you access them
such that we can allot points to each hacker.
To communicate these URLs,
\(bsend each URL as a message to \(bC555#4713\)b on Discord\)b.
The timestamp of your message will be used to calculate the points rewarded.
To reiterate,
you must send to \(bC555#4713\)b on Discord each CICADA URL
that you access such that you are given the points you deserve.
\P
For each URL of CICADA's, points are given to hackers in decreasing order.
That is, the first hacker to reach a CICADA URL will get, say, n points.
The hackers following will receive a decreased number of points,
decreasing by some constant, say, a, for each hacker.
For example, the second hacker will get n - a points, and the third, n - 2a points.
And so on and so forth.
Points are awarded as such for each individual CICADA page,
and a hacker's final score is the sum of each individual score.
A leaderboard will be lazily updated to display hacker's scores,
which can be found here: \(a$DOMAIN$/announcements/index.html\)a.
\P
Hackers are encouraged to collaborate and discuss puzzles with other hackers.
Outright sharing of solutions and URLs is not permitted,
and will result in a hacker being removed from the game entirely.
However, guiding another hacker through the process of solving a puzzle,
explaining steps carefully, is allowed.
\P
All manner of puzzles are before you.\n
Think outside of the box.\n
\(iNothing is as it seems.\)i\n
You will need to employ abnormal strategies on several occasions.
\P
Good luck.
