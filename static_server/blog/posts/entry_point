$CICADA$ Entry Point
C555
0 22 12 2022
Dear $EXEIRUS$,
\P
Today is a good day.
I have found the entry point through which we can access $CICADA$'s communication channels.
It appears to be guarded with several layers of cryptographic puzzles.
\P
I have encoded the entry point.
You know how to gain access.
