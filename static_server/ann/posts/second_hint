Second Hint

0 5 2 2023
Greetings, Hackers,
\P
Your second hint is as follows:
\P
There are eight keys that make up the master-key.
With the master-key, you must <i>unlock</i> a larger cipher than those you decrypted thus far.
This cipher is an encrypted <i>entry-point</i>.
It is only after you break the encryption on this entry-point that you can access CICADA's servers.
\P
There are two blocks that you must decipher.
One is visible, the other is hidden.
To decipher the second, you must decipher the first.
\P
You have all that you need to decipher these blocks;
look back to the methods you have used,
and follow your intuition.
\P
Happy hacking.
