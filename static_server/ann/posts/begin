Welcome to EXEIRUS.
\P
As you all may know, we, EXEIRUS, have summoned you here to prevent world devastation.
\P
CICADA, a rival hacker group, plans to hack the world.
\P
But we cannot defeat CICADA on our own,
we need your help.
\P
I have prepared a game to find who of you are the greatest hackers.
\P
And the greatest among us will fight CICADA, head-on.
\P
You will need to decrypt many ciphers,
and you will need to think outside of the box.
\P
Codes, secrets, lore; all is hidden in nearly every page.
\P
I must preface this event by saying that
I am sure none of you will defeat CICADA tonight.
\P
This could take days, or weeks, or months.
\P
I am not sure what defeating CICADA's encryption will lead you to,
but instructions will be given for how you must proceed.
\P
The first four hackers to defeat CICADA will win free CSSS hoodies,
and a trophy that we are currently designing.
\P
You may also have a most crisp handshake, if that is what you desire.
\P
Of course, you will also win eternal glory.
\P
To defeat CICADA is your primary goal, your ultimate purpose.
\P
To defeat CICADA is to save the world.
\P
As a side hustle,
we have hidden bonus keys everywhere,
and we will continue to release bonus key puzzles as this event proceeds.
\P
If you find a bonus key, you must send it to me on discord.
\P
My discord is directly accessible from the EXEIRUS announcements website,
linked to on the business cards you have received.
\P
Sending bonus keys to me will enter your name into a separate leaderboard,
for secondary prizes.
\P
By the end of this event,
the hackers that have submitted the most bonus keys the fastest,
will win something.
\P
I am not sure what, just yet, but something---perhaps pop coupons, perhaps snack coupons.
\P
If you feel stuck on a primary puzzle,
then perhaps taking a break to find a bonus-key will refresh your code-breaking skills.
\P
I have given you all business cards containing helpful links and rules pertaining to this event.
\P
Some links lead to online tools I recommend for solving ciphers.
\P
Other links lead to the CSSS discord server, where you can communicate with other hackers.
\P
For the rules of this event, they are simple.
\P
You are encouraged to collaborate with other hackers to solve puzzles.
\P
You are welcome to share your answers outright,
and allow other hackers to proceed into further layers.
\P
You are also welcome to do this event alone,
and not share anything with anyone.
\P
But, do remember that there is strength in numbers.
\P
Do not be shy to ask for help,
and do be kind and teach a fellow hacker your reasoning.
\P
Let us uplift each other and accomplish great things.
\P
But if you choose to harrass other hackers for answers,
or beg one of the members of EXEIRUS for a hint,
do slow down and rethink your actions.
\P
Such activity could prevent you from winning any major prizes,
even if you are first to succeed.
\P
Keep a cool head,
and be kind.
\P
Good luck.
