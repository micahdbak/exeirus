Congratulations, Hackers, for proceeding thus far.
\P
To clarify some things: there are 8 keys in total for the journal,
which must be used to break the CICADA entry point.
You must defeat CICADA for the event to be over,
so keep in mind that finding the entry point is just the beginning.
\P
Several of you have found every key, so well done.
And some of you have reached the CICADA entry point,
for this I congratulate you greatly.
\P
I will release another hint by the end of today, regarding my journal.
\P
Keep up the pace, hackers.

Also, another bonus key has been posted on my journal.
