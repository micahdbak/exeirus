Hello, World!
\P
This is an example post, written in a terminal.
In fact, this post is written using a custom text format written by Micah, which, for lack of a better name, I have termed 'blog-script'.
This is actually kind of hilarious because common file convention says that a 'blog-script' file should have the file extension of '.bs'.
Anyways, blog-script has several capabilities.
It is easier to define fields as being \(iitalic\)i, \(bbold\)b, \(sstriked\)s, \(uunderlined\)u, \(mmonospace\)m, and links can be created like \(a$DOMAIN$\)a that!
But, for links, I have made it that it automatically has the text 'Click Here' and nothing more. But, if you do click it, it goes to the link that was specified.
\P
Nevertheless, it is pretty neat.
\P
The main purpose of having posts such as these is that writing a post file is infinitely faster than writing an entire HTML web-page.
And, with the build tools created for EXEIRUS, you can compile hundreds of post files to hundreds of HTML web-pages in seconds!
Albeit, you would need to write hundreds of posts.
But the code works.
\P
I'm excited to make this project deeper!
\P
Micah
