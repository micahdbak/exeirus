# brainheck example

here is a brainheck program that has been expanded to make it more readable:
```c
3>
1<
1! 
8+ 8+ 8+ 9+
1<
8+ 8+ 8+ 8+ 8+ 8+ 8+ 8+ 9+
1<
8+ 8+ 8+ 8+ 8+ 8+ 8+ 8+ 8+
3.
```

here is this same program, but compressed:
```c
3>1<1!8+8+8+9+1<8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+9+1<8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+3.
```
